# General Info
I did this project during the front-end phase of an online full-stack Bootcamp provided by an online educational institution called Knowledge Academy after I was introduced to JavaScript.
# Project's Aim
Students were tasked to create a recipes web page using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This web page should feature an [API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) of recipe images with their description as texts. the api was done using ***`fetch function`***
# Projects Components
## 1.`Navigation bar`
The nav bar has multiple links of food categories; once clicked, the page will display all the available recipes for that food category from the server. 
## 2.`Recepie exhibt`
This is where data gets displayed after clicking on one of the links in the navbar, which then the data gets requested from the server. Additionally, It has two buttons underneath each picture:
* **Source button**: This button will open the website that hosts the recipe.
* **Details button**: This button triggers a popup with an image of the recipe and its description after requesting them from the server
